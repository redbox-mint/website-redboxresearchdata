## QCIF Support Agreements

QCIF provides support to institutions and organisations through an annual support arrangement.

For an annual fee QCIF will provide:

- Direct support to the client to resolve technical defects
- Access to QCIF's online support system through which to lodge support requests
- An invitation to the annual ReDBox User Group meeting to preview new releases as well as 
  discuss and agree a priority list of ReDBox features and enhancements for future development.
- An invitation to the client's technical staff to a subsequent Technical User Group meeting 
  in which QCIF will guide technical staff in new and future technical procedures.

By subscribing to our support agreement your annual fee funds ReDBox support and keeps ReDBox 
at the forefront of research data management technologies.

Please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.md %}) to discuss a suitable support agreement.

## ReDBox is Open Source

QCIF is proud to say that the ReDBox platform is Open Source software,
making it freely available for anyone to download, install and use.

This means that while QCIF manages the development of the platform,
we keep everything as transparent as possible.
We rely upon the interaction of our community to prioritise new features and participate
in the development and testing of the release cycles.

It also means that any development performed for a specific client
will be contributed back to the code base to the benefit of all.

## ReDBox is Open Source

QCIF is proud to say that the ReDBox platform is Open Source software,
making it freely available for anyone to download, install and use.

This means that while QCIF manages the development of the platform,
we keep everything as transparent as possible.
We rely upon the interaction of our community to prioritise new features and participate
in the development and testing of the release cycles.

It also means that any development performed for a specific client
will be contributed back to the code base to the benefit of all.

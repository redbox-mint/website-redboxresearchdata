We are grateful to the many people and organizations whose contributions have helped shape the development of 
ReDBox into the robust research data management platform it is today.

Special thanks go to the
[University of Southern Queensland](https://www.unisq.edu.au/), 
whose partnership in the original ANDS-funded project laid the foundation for ReDBox's creation.
We also acknowledge the 
[Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/)
for their continued support in fostering innovation and collaboration across the research sector.

The 
[University of Newcastle](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/)
has been a cornerstone of the ReDBox community from the beginning, providing invaluable feedback, 
feature requirements, site-testing, and documentation resources that have directly influenced the 
platform's development.
The 
[University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/)
has also contributed significant 
expertise and guidance, helping to enhance ReDBox's capabilities for the wider community.

We would also like to extend our gratitude to the **ReDBox subscriber institutions**, 
whose individual ReDBox projects have contributed to the platform's core development.
These institutions have played an essential role in shaping the roadmap of the ReDBox platform by 
providing use cases, feature suggestions, and actively participating in the development process.

This collaboration of universities, research institutions, and partners has been instrumental in 
driving the success of ReDBox, ensuring it remains a community-driven, open-source platform that 
meets the evolving needs of the research community.
We are grateful to these people and organisations for their continued support, which has made ReDBox 
a leading tool in research data management in Australia and New Zealand.

## Product history

The ReDBox platform originated as an **ANDS-funded** (Australian National Data Service) software development project,
supported by grants **EIF040** and **EIF048**, with the aim of creating a flexible, robust solution for managing research data. 
The project was initially developed in collaboration with the **University of Southern Queensland** and further
strengthened by partnerships with **QCIF** and **CQUniversity**.

From its early stages, ReDBox has been shaped by a strong community of contributors across Australian universities.
The **University of Newcastle** has been a key participant since the project’s inception, offering invaluable contributions 
to feature development, site-testing, and documentation, which have helped guide ReDBox’s evolution to better meet the
needs of research institutions.

Other notable contributors include **Flinders University** and **Swinburne University of Technology**, which have provided 
ongoing support, feedback, and practical insights that have helped refine the platform.
Their collaboration has helped establish ReDBox as an open-source solution that continues to evolve in response to the
changing needs of research communities.

As a result of these collaborative efforts, ReDBox has grown from a funded project into a widely used platform that
supports research data management, metadata curation, and data publication across academic and research institutions.
QCIF now leads the ongoing development and maintenance of ReDBox, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of 
research data management solutions.

Today, ReDBox is a testament to the power of **open collaboration** and community-driven innovation, 
with a growing user base and an ever-expanding feature set.

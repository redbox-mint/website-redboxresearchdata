## ReDBox and Provisioning

Through the ReDBox DLC Service, research staff can access and acquire the data infrastructure they need 
by provisioning services where they can create and manage their research data.
With built-in **Data Harvesting**, researchers can directly oversee and manage the data they create, 
ensuring smooth data governance throughout the research lifecycle.

A critical stage in the DLCF is linking research activities to the infrastructure and services 
used to store, manage, and process research data.
ReDBox enables researchers to specify their resource requirements, 
such as expected storage volumes or specialised environments, directly within the platform.

QCIF is enhancing ReDBox's provisioning capabilities by offering either **automated provisioning** 
or **resource request management**.
For instance, a researcher could request 20 GB of storage, which could be automatically provisioned via an API.
For more complex requests, such as larger storage volumes or specific environments 
like 
[GitHub, GitLab, Omero, Omeka, or predefined virtual machines (VMs)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link features/integration-options.md %}), 
ReDBox can trigger a customised workflow.
This workflow would follow institutional and service provider business rules, 
requesting and tracking necessary administrative and institutional approvals.

## ReDBox and Data Harvesting

Once researchers have acquired their storage and compute resources, 
ReDBox is designed to help them seamlessly manage and publish their data files.
For example, by integrating the **Intersect Collections tool**, researchers can easily select files from their storage, 
generate a comprehensive metadata manifest, and harvest the manifest (and optionally the data files) into ReDBox. 
This process ensures that research data is well-documented, organised, and ready for institutional management.

By bringing research data files under ReDBox and institutional control, researchers can securely manage their 
datasets while complying with institutional policies.
Additionally, the files and associated metadata can be published for **open access**, enhancing data visibility, 
reproducibility, and collaboration.

to meet the specific research data management needs of your institution.

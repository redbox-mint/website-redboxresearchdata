excerpt: Creating Data with ReDBox

## ReDBox and Provisioning

Under the ReDBox DLC Service research staff can access and acquire data infrastructure, 
by Provisioning the services where they can create their data.
Through Data Harvesting researchers can then directly manage the data they have created.

A key stage in the DLCF is linking research activities to the infrastructure and 
services used to store, manage, and process research data.
ReDBox allows researchers to indicate resource requirements such as expected storage volumes.
QCIF plans to extend ReDBox provisioning functions by either automating the provisioning or managing resource requests.

For example a researcher could request 20 GB of storage and have that automatically provisioned via an API.
For larger storage requests ReDBox would trigger a workflow, based on both institutional and storage provider business rules,
to request and track institutional and administrative authorisation.

## ReDBox and Data Harvesting

Once researchers have acquired their storage and compute resources, it is planned that ReDBox will assist researchers 
to directly manage and publish their data files.

For example, using the Intersect Collections tool would allow researchers to select the files they want to manage from 
their storage, create a metadata manifest of the files, 
and harvest the manifest (and optionally the data files) into ReDBox.

This places the research data files under ReDBox and institutional control.
The files and metadata can then be published for open access.

## Publish with ReDBox

At its core ReDBox is a customisable research data registry used for publishing research collection metadata.

ReDBox provides the forms, workflows and system integrations to assist institutions in creating and managing 
the metadata describing research data collections. It includes the innovative Mint platform to provide a lookup service 
for researcher information and project details, as well as commonly used research classifications, such as FOR codes.

ReDBox supports a variety of metadata formats and provides an OAI-PMH interface for metadata harvesting by 
repositories including Research Data Australia.

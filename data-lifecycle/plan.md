## Research Data Management Plan

The ReDBox Research Data Management Plan (RDMP) tool is integrated into the core ReDBox offering.
The RDMP tool allows researchers to document how they plan to collect, store, secure and share their research data.

Research data management planning is now encouraged in all Australian Universities and ReDBox provides customisable 
forms and workflows to assist researchers, supervisors and administrators in creating, tracking and approving RDMPs.

ReDBox supports [Research Activity Identifiers (RAiDs)](https://raid.org/), allowing users to add existing RAiDs 
to a data management plan or create new RAiDs.
The RAiD can be a key identifier to tie together the data management plan, the provisioned storage and the published data collection.

QCIF provides the full ReDBox functionality in the Cloud using the Software as a Service (SaaS) model.

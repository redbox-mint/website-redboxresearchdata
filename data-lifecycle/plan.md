## Research Data Management Plan

The ReDBox Research Data Management Plan (RDMP) tool is a key feature integrated into the core ReDBox platform.
It empowers researchers to effectively plan how they will collect, store, secure, and share their research data,
ensuring compliance with institutional and funding requirements.
With research data management planning increasingly emphasised across Australian universities,
ReDBox offers customizable forms and workflows to assist researchers, supervisors, and administrators
in creating, tracking, and approving RDMPs tailored to institutional needs.

ReDBox also supports
[Research Activity Identifiers (RAiDs)](https://raid.org/),
allowing users to seamlessly link existing RAiDs
to a data management plan or create new RAiDs.
These RAiDs serve as key identifiers that connect the research data management plan with the corresponding storage
and published data collections, enhancing the traceability and organization of research outputs.

Additionally, ReDBox has the capability to
[mint DataCite Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)](https://datacite.org/create-dois/),
providing globally recognized, persistent identifiers for datasets.
This feature allows researchers to publish their data with confidence,
knowing it will be easily discoverable and citable in the academic community.

QCIF offers the full ReDBox platform in the cloud through a Software as a Service (SaaS) model,
providing institutions with a flexible and scalable solution.

institution's specific research data management requirements.

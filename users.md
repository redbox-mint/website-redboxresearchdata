## ReDBox is for any organisation that needs to manage and publish data

ReDBox is primarily used by Australian universities to capture and publish the metadata for Australian research data collections.

However, ReDBox is a solution for any organisation that needs to manage and publish data collections.

## ReDBox is an international solution

ReDBox utilises standardized language files to configure it for usage in any language.
ReDBox can be configured to integrate with the in-house or cloud hosted systems of any organisation and 
can publish data and metadata to any platform, such as DataCite conforming repositories, 
or open data publishing portals such as CKAN.

## ReDBox is for governments

ReDBox is a tool for managing data catalogues within and across government agencies.

ReDBox workflows can manage the authorisation process around sharing of data between agencies,
and publishing data to shared resource repositories, or open data portals.
